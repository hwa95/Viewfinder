Viewfinder

CMPT276 - TEAM6

Document Header Project Name: Viewfinder Requirements and Specification Document 01/31/2018

Project Abstract:
Viewfinder is a web application for tourists, hikers, or locals looking for a place to walk their dog. The application provides information regarding parks and scenic views in Vancouver. Users can filter information by location, rating, and type. Viewfinder can reduce users' time to find a desirable park or view. Furthermore, the application provides users with information on which parks are safe to visit. The application also allows users to interact with the Google maps API, access photos of individual locations and retrieve general information about a particular park or view.

The application can provide users with information regarding the safety, cleanliness of parks, and unleashed dog allowance which existing Analysis Park finding client-server applications fail to do. The application also includes common features such as distance filer and rating system.

User Stories:
We have two types of customers: customer type 1, and customer type 2. A type 1 customer does not need to login to use the application. This customer can access information, but cannot contribute ratings. A type 2 customer has an account and must login to access type 2 privileges. A type 2 customer can make new ratings of parks or views. We also have administrator users.

As a “type 1 customer,” I want to quickly find useful information about the quality of parks and views that are close and accessible.

As a “type 2 customer,” I want to easily and conveniently contribute ratings to parks and views in Vancouver.

As an “administrator,” I want to have permission to edit user content.

Scope and Responsibilities:
The amount of work required for this project is appropriate for CMPT 276. Tasks include:
- Implement the model-view-controller architecture
- Create a user login page

- Build database by scraping data (Vancouver Park information) from existing database
- Add new data to the built database
- Develop unit testing and integration testing
- Understand and use byebug
- Prepare a presentation

The tools required to build this application are new to all of us.
